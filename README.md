# Responsive-Home-Page

Please see live view at http://lcdonaldson.github.io/Responsive-Home-Page/responsive/

This mini-project was given to me as a code test for timed task completion.
I added the skeleton grid for responsiveness and left out the tasks with javascript for the time being.
This is just an example, and in no way represents a project built for rockfish. I simply used their image
files for placeholders.

I think overall this would be best used as a quick template for someones personal site, but mainly I had
fun trying to figure out small hacks around the skeleton framework to get the right visual effect.

** This was part of a code challenge some years back and I have decided to redo it in CSS Grid. **
